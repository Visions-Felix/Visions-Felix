## Hey: a quick introduction

My experience has 2 sides to it, since this is GitHub, let's start with the development one.

### Developer experience

I am a fullstack developer working as a freelancer. I have made my development studies at OpenClassrooms and have been working for several clients since.

By the end of my studies, I have joined a startup : Visions, for which I work as a freelancer on a weekly basis. My work there has made my development abilities to be oriented towards what they do, meaning NodeJS, API development, and a Web App with all the frontend that comes with it.

On my own personnal time, I am also building a game as an indie game developer. The game is made under Unity and C# and is a project on which I work on development, game design, UX/UI, sound and music.

#### `Dev work`

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Visions on a consent based personnal data operator. Building an API and the Web App tools that go with it.
- 🧭 [tour.js](https://github.com/FelixBole/tour.js) a frontend interactive guide tool.
- 👨‍💼 [yli-group.com](https://yli-group.com/) a coaching platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Typescript, React and C# (Unity)

### Sound & Music

Most of my life's experience though, evolves around sound and music. I've been a musician since I was 2 years old and have been making music ever since.

My initial studies were at EICAR, a cinema school. I graduated a Bachelor in Sound and have been continuing to make music, sound, sound engineering and sound recording as a freelancer ever since. 

#### `Music`

- 🎼 I've released a game/film music album called [Journey](https://felixbole.bandcamp.com/album/journey)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the sound and music for the game I am building
- 🎹 I've toured with a French band called Le Horla as a pianist and guitarist, and got to be finalist of the Emergenza french tremplin
